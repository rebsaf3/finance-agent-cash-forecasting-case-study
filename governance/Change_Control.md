# Change Control
Every change must be visible, reviewable, and testable.

Required steps
1. Create an issue describing the change and why it is needed
2. Identify impacted docs, scenarios, or tests
3. Update tests when behavior changes
4. Record results in the change log
5. Release using a tagged version when appropriate
