# 02 Problem And Risks
Cash forecasting is often slow because the hard part is not math.
The hard part is collecting inputs, validating them, and explaining changes.

Common risks
1. Missing inputs cause silent errors
2. Estimates get presented as actuals
3. Different analysts use different assumptions
4. Files and scopes get mixed up
5. Outputs cannot be audited after the fact

A Finance Agent only helps if it is designed to avoid these failures.
